# CG-M-AssignmentTwo
Code made by Yoran Kerbusch for Edge Hill University course CIS2160 Computer Graphics &amp; Modelling 2018-2019 for assignment 2

This code was made for assignments given at Edge Hill University for second-year class CIS2160 Computer Graphics & Moddeling, during 2018-2019.

This coursework sees students having to make an animated model of our solar system using Java3D/StdDraw3D. Students are free to expand further on the basic requirements of: The planets must rotate, the planets must be textured & the planets must receive lighting from the central planet, the Sun.

The final grade I received for this portfolio of code I made for the assignment is 100.0%, and it was originally completed by me at 9-4-2019 (9th of April, 2019).

My code includes a wide variety of added features, including planet paths, realistic movement per unit of real passed time, angled orbits and a wide suite of camera controls. To learn how this works and operates, please consult the documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TkQAUutyxsCyA3oU6S2ulDyG39OgNulf3xfUOV-8URE/edit?usp=sharing

DISCLAIMER: Two files, named "KeplerBodyTest.java" and "KeplerSolarSystemTest.java" are not working, thus, do not see them as reflective of the project. This was in an attempt to make the planets move completely realistic, according to the time the user starts up the animation, using real planetary calculations. I never continued this, as I couldn't make it work (I'm not a physacist, after all), but with the effort I put in I decided to keep the code in for the teachers to review. For more information on my efforts, check the linked documentation.
